Food Express - Online Food Ordering with Nutrition Value Calculator
Project Overview
Food Express is a modern restaurant website designed to provide a seamless online food ordering experience while promoting healthy eating habits. The platform allows users to explore a diverse menu, place orders, and access detailed nutritional information for each item. Integrated with the CalorieNinja API, the platform calculates calorie and nutrition values in real-time, helping users make informed dietary choices.

Key Features
 User-Friendly Interface: A responsive front-end built with React.js, offering a smooth user experience across devices.
 Dynamic Menu: Users can browse through the menu, view food descriptions, prices, and customize their orders.
 Order Management: Add items to a cart, customize orders, and check out with ease.
 Calorie Tracker: Integrated with the CalorieNinja API to calculate nutritional information, including calorie content, fat, proteins, and more.
 Admin Dashboard: Restaurant owners can manage the menu with easeâ€”adding, updating, or deleting food items.
 Health-Conscious Choices: Tailored for fitness enthusiasts, vegans, and health-conscious users with nutritional transparency.
Motivation
Food Express was developed to address the increasing demand for transparency in food ingredients and nutritional content in online food ordering. As health awareness rises, customers want more detailed nutritional information. This project combines the convenience of online food ordering with comprehensive nutrition tracking, supporting users in maintaining a balanced and healthy diet.

Problem Statement
While there are existing food ordering systems, most lack calorie tracking and nutritional transparency. This creates challenges for health-conscious customers who want to monitor their dietary intake. Furthermore, restaurant administrators often struggle with outdated or inefficient menu management. Food Express solves these issues by integrating calorie tracking, offering detailed nutrition information, and providing a streamlined menu management system for administrators.
